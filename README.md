# PAI-Project

For our PAI course project, we are building several disease prediction systems, including heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, and breast cancer classification. Using machine learning algorithms, we aim to analyze patient data and improve the accuracy of early diagnosis, providing valuable insights to healthcare professionals.

# Diabetes Prediction System using Pima Indian Dataset

This project is a machine learning application to predict diabetes using the **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset**. It includes a **Tkinter-based GUI** for individual and batch predictions, and features a **Login and Registration system** to manage user access securely.

---

## Features

- **Authentication System:**
  - User **Registration** with secure password hashing.
  - **Login** functionality with input validation.
  - Encrypted user credentials storage.
  
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Ensemble Voting Classifier (Soft Voting)

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualizations (Histograms, Boxplots, Pairplots, Correlation Heatmap)

- **GUI:**
  - Predict individual diabetes outcomes.
  - Batch prediction from CSV files.
  - Light/Dark themes.
  - Validation of inputs.
  - Save prediction results.

- **Model Persistence:** Save and load trained models with `joblib`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamrayyan1/PAI-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PAI-Project
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
    ```

## Authentication System

Before using the prediction system, users must register and log in through a secure interface. This ensures that only authorized users can access the application.

### Steps:

1. **Register a new user:**
    - Enter your desired username and password.
    - Passwords are stored securely using hashing.
  
     ![Reg Example](https://github.com/iamrayyan1/PAI-Project/blob/main/images/reg%20page.png)

2. **Login:**
    - Enter your registered credentials to access the main application.

## Dataset

- **Name:** Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset
- **Description:** This dataset contains medical diagnostic measurements for predicting the onset of diabetes based on specific factors. It has 768 entries with 8 features and a target variable (`Outcome`).

---

## Machine Learning Workflow

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values using median imputation.
   - Address outliers using the **IQR method**.
   - Scale features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Class Imbalance Handling:**
   - Applied **SMOTETomek** for oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Models Used:
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Ensemble Voting Classifier
   - Train-Test Split: 80%-20% with stratification.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Metrics:
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Accuracy
     - Classification Report
     - ROC-AUC Score

## Tkinter GUI Application

The **Tkinter-based GUI** provides an intuitive interface for predictions.

- **Individual Predictions:** Enter patient data manually.
- **Batch Predictions:** Load and predict multiple records from a CSV file.
- **Themes:** Switch between Light/Dark themes.
- **Help Section:** Tooltips for input fields and detailed instructions.
